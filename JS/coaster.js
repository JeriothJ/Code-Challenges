// I'm in charge of a roller coaster with a long line. I have a height measurement tool to see who can ride. It's tough to check everyone individually, so can you help me find out who's tall enough? Anyone over 165 cm can ride.

let height=155
if(height>=165){
    console.log("You can ride the Roller Coaster")
}
else{
    console.log("You're not allowed to ride")
}
